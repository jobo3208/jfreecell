# jfreecell

`jfreecell` is a basic version of FreeCell written in Java.

Simple compile and run:

    $ cd src
    $ javac freecell/*.java
    $ java freecell.FreeCell

This game works very much like the original Windows version: click a card to 
select it, then click a column or a cell to move it there. Click in the green 
area to cancel a move. You can also double-click to auto-move.
